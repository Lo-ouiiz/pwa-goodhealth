As part of my final project for the **BUT Multimedia and Internet Professions** program, I developed a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** in **React JS** dedicated to **health and wellness tracking**.  

The application provides comprehensive tracking for **weight, sleep, and hydration** through an intuitive interface and clear charts.  
- Users can **log their weight regularly** and track their progress.  
- The **sleep tracking feature** helps analyze nighttime habits and make adjustments if necessary.  
- A dedicated **hydration tracking feature** assists in monitoring daily water intake for better hydration.  

This project allowed me to apply my **web development skills** and create a practical solution to enhance users' well-being.
